            Effective Git workflows are essential for development teams to collaborate efficiently. In this article, we'll explore popular Git workflow models and best practices that improve collaboration, code quality, and project organization.
          </p>
          
          <div className="flex items-center my-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
            <GitBranch className="w-12 h-12 text-highlands-primary mr-4" />
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Workflows Matter</h3>
              <p className="m-0">
                A structured Git workflow minimizes merge conflicts, ensures code quality, and creates a clear path for features to move from development to production.

          <h2>1. Common Git Workflow Models</h2>
          <h3>Gitflow Workflow</h3>
          <p>
            The Gitflow workflow uses two main branches with infinite lifetime:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>main/master:</strong> Contains production-ready code</li>
            <li><strong>develop:</strong> Integration branch for features</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Supporting branches include:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>feature/*:</strong> For new features (branched from develop)</li>
            <li><strong>release/*:</strong> Prepare for production release</li>
            <li><strong>hotfix/*:</strong> Fix critical bugs in production</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center my-10">
            <GitMerge className="w-16 h-16 text-highlands-primary" />
          </div>
          
          <h3>GitHub Flow</h3>
          <p>
            A simpler alternative to Gitflow with a focus on continuous delivery:
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Branch from main</li>
            <li>Add commits</li>
            <li>Open a pull request</li>
            <li>Discuss and review code</li>
            <li>Deploy and test</li>
            <li>Merge to main</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            This approach is ideal for teams that deploy frequently and prioritize simplicity.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Trunk-Based Development</h3>
          <p>
            A workflow where developers collaborate on a single branch (trunk):
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Developers make small, frequent commits to the main branch</li>
            <li>Feature flags hide incomplete work in production</li>
            <li>Short-lived feature branches (less than a day) may be used</li>
            <li>Continuous integration runs on every commit</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div className="flex items-center my-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
            <GitPullRequest className="w-12 h-12 text-highlands-primary mr-4" />
            <p className="m-0">
              <strong>Workflow Selection Tip:</strong> Choose a workflow that matches your team size, deployment frequency, and project complexity. Simpler is often better for smaller teams.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>2. Branch Naming Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            Consistent branch naming improves visibility and organization:
          </p>
          
          <pre><code>{`
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes
fix/header-overlap
fix/payment-calculation

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/critical-data-loss

# Releases
release/v1.2.0
release/quarterly-update
          `}</code></pre>
          
          <p>
            Consider adding ticket numbers for better traceability:
          </p>
          
          <pre><code>{`
feature/ABC-123-user-profile
fix/ABC-456-login-error
          `}</code></pre>
          
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center my-10">
            <Users className="w-16 h-16 text-highlands-primary" />
          </div>
          
          <h2>3. Pull Request Best Practices</h2>
          <p>
            Pull requests (PRs) are central to effective collaboration. Follow these practices for better PRs:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep them small:</strong> Aim for PRs under 400 lines of code</li>
            <li><strong>Write descriptive titles and descriptions:</strong> Explain what, why, and how</li>
            <li><strong>Include context:</strong> Link to relevant tickets, docs, or discussions</li>
            <li><strong>Run tests locally before submitting:</strong> Don't waste reviewer time on failing tests</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to feedback promptly:</strong> Keep the review cycle moving</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>PR Template Example</h3>

          <h2>4. Commit Message Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            Well-structured commit messages create a useful project history. Consider using Conventional Commits:
          </p>
          
          <pre><code>{`
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
          `}</code></pre>
          
          <p>
            Where:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>type:</strong> feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore</li>
            <li><strong>scope:</strong> The component or area affected (optional)</li>
            <li><strong>subject:</strong> A short description in imperative mood</li>
            <li><strong>body:</strong> Detailed explanation (optional)</li>
            <li><strong>footer:</strong> Breaking changes, references to issues (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <pre><code>{`
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

fix(payment): correct calculation of taxes on international orders

docs: update installation instructions for Windows users

refactor(api): simplify error handling middleware
          `}</code></pre>
          
          <div className="flex items-center my-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
            <CheckCircle className="w-12 h-12 text-highlands-primary mr-4" />
            <p className="m-0">
              <strong>Automation Tip:</strong> Use tools like Commitlint and Husky to enforce commit message conventions and run pre-commit checks.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>5. Code Review Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            Effective code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Be respectful and constructive:</strong> Focus on the code, not the person</li>
            <li><strong>Review for functionality AND maintainability:</strong> Consider future developers</li>
            <li><strong>Ask questions rather than make demands:</strong> "Have you considered...?" instead of "Change this to..."</li>
            <li><strong>Don't nitpick style issues:</strong> Use linters and formatters instead</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledge good solutions:</strong> Code reviews shouldn't only be about criticism</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>6. Release Management</h2>
          <p>
            A structured release process ensures smooth deployments:
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Version tagging:</strong> Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)</li>
            <li><strong>Release notes:</strong> Document changes, improvements, and fixes</li>
            <li><strong>Release branches:</strong> Create branches for preparing releases</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment strategy:</strong> Define clear steps for staging and production</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            An effective Git workflow is foundational to productive development teams. By choosing the right workflow model, establishing clear conventions, and implementing best practices, you can improve collaboration and deliver higher quality code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that workflows should evolve with your team. Regularly evaluate your process and make adjustments as your team size, project complexity, and deployment needs change.
